It is one word that does not inspire us to want to associate with the church.\nThat word is the word “judgment”.\nIt is one of the strongest negatives we associate with the church.\nAnd the reason for that is pretty simple.\nWe have a negative view of what it means to judge.\nWhen the church says it is the last and final judge, we think, “You mean you’re going to decide who is going to heaven and who is going to hell?\nOr when the church says it is righteous in judgment, it doesn’t really inspire us to think they are being merciful. We think they are being judgmental.\nAnd when we think they are being judgmental, we think they are not showing mercy.\nSo the church has a problem. It is how it can say it is the righteous judge, merciful in its judgment, and also not be seen as being judgmental or unkind or harsh.\nThat’s a pretty tough balance.\nWhat does judgment really mean? In the Judeo Christian tradition, God judges everyone. And if we are not judged by God, we are judged by others.\nGod judges everyone at the end of their life, and if they do not want to be judged by God, they have to judge themselves before they die.\nAnd that means they have to judge their actions.\nIn our modern American society, to judge is to condemn or to criticize.\nBut that is not what judgment is.\nTo judge is to make a decision about what to do in a particular situation.\nAs an example, if you need to decide whether to buy a house, you look at its price and its size and the distance from where you work.\nThe purpose of judging is to decide if the house is right for you.\nAnother example is deciding whether to buy a car. You weigh the pros and cons, and if the pros outweigh the cons, you buy that car.\nAnd you do this with most of the things you do in your life.\nSo judgment is an everyday occurrence.\nBut the question is whether the church is being righteous in its judgment.\nIf it is, its judgment will be seen as good, not bad.\nIf it is not, its judgment will be seen as bad, not good.\nWhat does the Church say about Judgment? The Church has a lot of different statements about judgment.\nJudgment Day The most obvious one is Judgment Day.\nThe Church believes that there will be a day when God will judge everyone who has lived on earth, past, present, and future, including everyone who is still living today.\nSecond Coming The Church also believes that at the end of time, Jesus will come back to earth and judge everyone who is living at that time.\nThe Church is very clear about what it means to be a Christian, and that is to be a follower of Jesus.\nAnd the Church is equally clear that Jesus is the only way to heaven.\nForgiveness of Sins One of the most well-known teachings of Jesus is that he wants everyone to be forgiven for their sins.\nAnd if you have never sinned, you do not need to be forgiven.\nBut if you have, then you must. That is why Jesus came to earth.\nRighteous Jesus taught that if you follow him and believe in him, you will be righteous.\nAnd righteous is the opposite of sinful.\nAnd if you are righteous, you have no more need to repent and ask forgiveness from God.\nJustification And if you are righteous, you have the right to judgment.\nThis means that you have the right to be judged by God.\nAnd God has the right to judge you.\nBut righteousness is not the same as being righteous.\nThe Bible is clear about this, Jesus is clear about this.\nThe difference is in the attitude of your heart.\nIf you are righteous, you are not self-righteous.\nHow are people losing their religion? Religion is the belief that God exists and that God created the world.\nReligion is the belief that God created the world and that God is interested in what happens in the world.\nReligion is also the belief that God wants us to do certain things.\nReligion is the belief that God wants us to have faith in God’s existence.\nAnd religion is the belief that God wants us to live according to God’s ways.\nBut religion does not have to be religious.\nPeople can be religious and not have religion.\nThey can be religious and not believe in God.\nAnd they can be religious and believe in God but not have religion.\nThey can be religious and believe in God but do not have any religion.\nThey can be religious and believe in God but do not practice religion.\nPeople can be religious and not be religious.\nThey can be religious and not believe in God.\nAnd they can be religious and believe in God but not practice religion.\nThey can be religious and believe in God but do not have any religion.\nPeople can be religious and believe in God but do not practice religion.\nPeople can be religious and believe in God but do not have any religion.\nPeople can be religious and believe in God but do not practice religion.\nPeople can be religious and believe in God but do not practice religion.\nPeople can be religious and believe in God but do not practice religion.\nHow can the Church respond? In the United States, the Church is losing its numbers.\nThe Church has been losing its numbers for decades now.\nIn the 1960s, the Church was at 17%.\nThen it dropped to 16% in the 1970s.\nThen it went up to 17% in the 1980s.\nThen it dropped again to 16% in the 1990s.\nThen it went up again to 17% in the 2000s.\nSo over the past 25 years, the Church has been in decline.\nBut we’re not alone.\nIn the United Kingdom, the Church is also in decline.\nIn 1965, it was at 19%.\nThen it went up to 20% in the 1970s.\nThen it dropped to 16% in the 1980s.\nThen it went up again to 20% in the 1990s.\nThen it dropped again to 16% in the 2000s.\nSo over the past 25 years, the Church has been in decline.\nConclusion People have a right to be angry at the Church.\nBut they can’t be angry at the Church without understanding why we exist.\nThey can be angry at what the Church teaches.\nBut they can’t be angry at the Church without understanding what we teach.\nAnd they can be angry at the Church without understanding why we exist.\n","wordCount":"1189","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-03T17:51:33Z","dateModified":"2024-03-03T17:51:33Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://niszpjllj.github.io/posts/91982127-why-people-are-losing-their-religion-and-how-the-church-can-respond/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Niszpjllj","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://niszpjllj.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://niszpjllj.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Niszpjllj (Alt + H)">Niszpjllj</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Why People Are Losing Their Religion (and How the Church Can Respond)</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-03 17:51:33 +0000 UTC'>March 3, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="What does judgment really mean?">What does judgment really mean?</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="What does the Church say about Judgment?">What does the Church say about Judgment?</a><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Judgment Day">Judgment Day</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Second Coming">Second Coming</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Forgiveness of Sins">Forgiveness of Sins</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label=Righteous>Righteous</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label=Justification>Justification</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=# aria-label="How are people losing their religion?">How are people losing their religion?</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="How can the Church respond?">How can the Church respond?</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label=Conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>When we think of words associated with the church, we think of positive words like faith, hope, and love.</p><p>We think of inspiring words like faith, grace, and community.</p><p>We think of words that put us on the side of the angels like mercy, justice, and peace.</p><p>But there is one word that is not a positive association with the church.
