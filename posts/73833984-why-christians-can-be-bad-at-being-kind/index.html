The Great War killed 9 million soldiers and another 7 million civilians, and yet, unbelievably, it began as a conflict over two dead ducks.\nTo the Christian heart, the idea that ducks could start a war is preposterous. On the other hand, we are not too astonished by the idea that Jesus Christ would die to save sinners. For the Christian, redemption is the ultimate work of God. We believe that, being angry with the whole human race as we are, God resolved to be kind to us in order that we might be saved.\nThe problem is that, while Christians understand the amazing thing that happened on the Cross, we don’t know why God has done it. We don’t know how He saved us. We don’t know how He was kind to us. When it comes to God’s kindness, we are woefully inadequate. We’re like those firemen who watched in horror and fascination as their own station went up in flames because they did not have a single extinguisher and they didn’t know how to use one.\nIn this article I’m going to attempt to make us wiser. I’m going to give you a few extinguishers and show you how to use them. I’m going to show you what it means for God to be kind to sinners. I’m going to show you how you can be kind as a Christian.\nWhy Christians Don’t Know How to Be Kind I’m going to suggest two reasons why Christians struggle with kindness.\n1) We think kindness is too easy. Sometimes Christians give up the battle against sin as a lost cause because we think it’s beyond us.\n“I know this is wrong. I hate this. I’m sorry about this. But I just don’t have it in me.”\nFor example, if I’m being rude, I’ll say, “I’m sorry.” But I have no idea how to stop being rude. I might have the grace and the resources to turn from unkindness, but I don’t know how to use them.\nConsequently, it’s much easier to take the attitude, “If it comes naturally, great. If not, who cares?”\nSuch an approach is understandable, but it’s also dangerous. When we talk about kindness, we are talking about a person called “Jesus,” and He is the most serious, hard-hearted person that we know. He does not tolerate cruelty. He does not accept a bad attitude. He demands our whole commitment and total devotion, and there is no one more committed and devoted to the Lord than the perfect Lamb, Jesus Christ, the Son of God.\nWhat we need, therefore, is not an easier life, a lighter load, a little more leeway. What we need is to be transformed from the inside out so that we become as committed to kindness as Jesus is to kindness.\nAs C. S. Lewis said, “Just as man has been able to make war, he is able to make peace. To make peace will be the difficult thing… It will mean taking our own side in our own quarrel. It will mean becoming kind in the face of cruelty; the more cruelty we see, the more kindly must we be. It will mean becoming generous in the face of stinginess; the more stinginess we see, the more generous must we be. It will mean becoming just in the face of injustice; the more injustice we see, the more just must we be.”\n2) We don’t see God’s kindness as real. God is kind. Really kind. Look at the Bible’s accounts of His kindness:\n• God never left Eden (Genesis 3:24). • God never stopped visiting Abraham (Genesis 18:21). • God never gave up on Moses (Exodus 32:10). • God never abandoned David (2 Samuel 7:15). • God never forgot His people in exile (Psalm 139:9). • God never stopped loving Jesus (Hebrews 4:15).\nBut what are these little snap shots if compared to God’s kindness forever?\nGod is always kind. Every year there are 52 Sundays, and on every Sunday God is kind. He was kind to our forefathers. He is kind to us. He will be kind to our children. God is never unkind and He will never be unkind.\nWhen we come to think of it, that’s pretty incredible. We live in a world of storms and earthquakes. We live in a world where people are selfish, hateful, and mean. But we live in a world where God is kind.\nWhen we begin to appreciate it, the more and more kind we will be.\nThe Reward of God’s Kindness The Bible shows us that God’s kindness is amazing, but it also shows us that God’s kindness is rewarded. When God is kind, things break His way. The Bible sa ys that it is to our advantage when God is kind to us (Hebrews 5:7).\nThis is all over the Bible. One example is when Jesus says,\n“And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, he will certainly not lose his reward.” (Matthew 10:42)\nThere are other examples as well. When God is kind, good things happen.\nThe question for us is, “Is your Christian life working?”\nSome days, I’m sure you’ve sat down at the end of the day and felt frustrated. You might have said, “I really tried. I gave my all.” I’ve even said some days, “Maybe the Christian life wasn’t for me. Maybe I was mistaken. Maybe it would have been better if I’d never become a Christian at all.”\nThe problem with this feeling is that God doesn’t reward a good attitude. God doesn’t reward an honest heart. He rewards kindness. When you’re kind, the Christian life works. The Christian life works when you’re kind to God. The Christian life works when you’re kind to people.\nGod is always kind to us. He is always kind to His people. It’s time that we rewarded Him.\nThe Imitation of God’s Kindness When I was young, I was discouraged and frustrated because of a lack of social skills. My mom would tell me, “Be friendly. Smile at people. Say ‘hello’ and ‘goodbye.’ Offer them your seat on the bus. Say ‘please’ and ‘thank you.’”\nI knew that my mom was right, but I really didn’t want to do those things. I’m not a social person, and I was always afraid that people would see through me and find out I’m not really friendly.\nThe Bible, however, gives me a reason for being kind. In fact, it gives me many reasons. Jesus said,\n“Your Father in heaven is kind. And you are to be kind like your Father in heaven is kind.” (Matthew 5:48 GW)\nTalk about motivation! God is kind to you. Therefore, you are to be kind to Him.\nMany people misunderstand this passage. They think of kindness as a fuzzy, feel-good sentiment, and they think, “I don’t have to be kind to God. He doesn’t care whether I’m kind or not. I don’t have to be like Him.”\nThey are wrong. God is kind to you. Therefore, you are to be kind to Him.\nGod is kind to you. Therefore, you are to be kind to Him.\n• When He hears you, you are to be kind to Him. • When He provides for you, you are to be kind to Him. • When He protects you, you are to be kind to Him. • When He saves you, you are to be kind to Him.\nThe Bible is clear: You are to be kind to God.\nKindness to People As God is kind to you, He expects you to be kind to other people. In fact, the Bible calls this outright. Jesus Christ said, “Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven.” (Luke 6:37 GW)\nPaul expanded the command like this:\nDo not be angry or sinful. Don’t yell at each other or insult each other. Be kind and loving to each other. Forgive each other as quickly and\n","wordCount":"1386","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-10T15:12:05Z","dateModified":"2024-03-10T15:12:05Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://niszpjllj.github.io/posts/73833984-why-christians-can-be-bad-at-being-kind/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Niszpjllj","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://niszpjllj.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://niszpjllj.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Niszpjllj (Alt + H)">Niszpjllj</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Why Christians Can Be Bad at Being Kind</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-10 15:12:05 +0000 UTC'>March 10, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;7 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Why Christians Don’t Know How to Be Kind">Why Christians Don’t Know How to Be Kind</a><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="1) We think kindness is too easy.">1) We think kindness is too easy.</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="2) We don’t see God’s kindness as real.">2) We don’t see God’s kindness as real.</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=# aria-label="The Reward of God’s Kindness">The Reward of God’s Kindness</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="The Imitation of God’s Kindness">The Imitation of God’s Kindness</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Kindness to People">Kindness to People</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>As I write, the air is dense with the tang of blood, the roar of war, the cries of the dying, and the painful sobs of the bereaved.
