From the first flight to landing on the moon, to the latest release of an iPhone, we have been living and thriving in the midst of an ever-evolving technological landscape. Yet, it seems that at times our culture moves forward so fast that we quickly become dependent on the next latest and greatest.\nAs believers, we understand the importance of growing in our faith and becoming more like Christ, but where does this leave us in terms of technology and its advancement? Are Christians simply opposed to every innovation, or do we embrace the beauty of progress? As the world moves forward at an increasingly rapid pace, it is important that we as Christians seek to be informed and wise in our understanding of how we should approach new developments in technology.\nThe Importance of Understanding Our Relationship With Technology First, it is important to understand the importance of having a healthy relationship with technology. Many times we get so wrapped up in the use and creation of new technologies that we forget to stop and ask “why”? Why are we pushing for this particular development? What is it going to do for us, and how will it benefit humanity as a whole? We must be mindful that our reliance on technological advancements cannot overshadow our relationship with Jesus Christ, and that true progress is not merely about the latest trends, but about pushing forward in the Kingdom of God.\nThe Danger of Overreliance on Technology Second, it is important to recognize the dangers of overreliance on technology. Often times, we fall into the trap of relying too heavily on technology to solve our problems, when really it is about working together with others to solve problems and progress in life. Overreliance on technology can create a sense of disconnect, and if we are not careful it can also lead to becoming slaves to our devices and creations. This is not to say that technology is bad, rather that we should be aware of how it influences our lives, and how it can also serve as a distraction from our primary goal of serving Jesus Christ.\nThe Importance of Discerning Between Good and Bad Technology Third, it is important to understand the importance of discerning between good and bad technology. We must remember that not all progress in technology is good, and that just because something is new and shiny doesn’t make it inherently right. We must be willing to examine the motives behind the development of new technologies, and understand its potential consequences before rushing headlong into its implementation. Discernment is key to not only being wise and understanding why an innovation is important, but also being able to understand the full impact it can have on our lives.\nAs Christians, we should always be thoughtful and prayerful about the role technology plays in our lives. We must be wise enough to understand where to draw the line between good and bad technology, and how it fits into the larger picture of humanity’s quest for progress. In doing so, we can then use our reliance on technology to further serve God’s Kingdom and push forward in the spirit of Christ-like humility and love.\n","wordCount":"549","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-02-28T09:09:25Z","dateModified":"2024-02-28T09:09:25Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://niszpjllj.github.io/posts/16540815-how-should-christians-approach-progress-in-technology/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Niszpjllj","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://niszpjllj.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://niszpjllj.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Niszpjllj (Alt + H)">Niszpjllj</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">How Should Christians Approach Progress in Technology?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-02-28 09:09:25 +0000 UTC'>February 28, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="The Importance of Understanding Our Relationship With Technology">The Importance of Understanding Our Relationship With Technology</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="The Danger of Overreliance on Technology">The Danger of Overreliance on Technology</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="The Importance of Discerning Between Good and Bad Technology">The Importance of Discerning Between Good and Bad Technology</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>It’s no secret that our modern era is marked by vast technological advancements and achievements.
